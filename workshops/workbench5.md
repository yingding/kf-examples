# Working with python juypter notebook

If you have kept the `test` juypterlab workbench from prevous tutorial, you can proceed.

If you have created a new juypterlab workbench, you can download the workshop git repository from the terminal with:
```shell
cd $HOME;
git clone https://github.com/yingding/kf-examples;
```

## Access the python notebook example

Navigate to `/home/jovyan/kf-examples/sdkV1` folder from the JupyterLab file browser.

Open the python notebook file `exploring-iris-data-notebook.ipynb` by double click on it
